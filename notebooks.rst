Notebooks allow you to create custom scripts that can be run within your dataflow using the *ExecuteProcess* and *ExecuteStreamCommand* processors.

Verteego comes with a few pre-installed kernels to cover the most common languages used by data scientists:

- Python 2.7
- R
- Bash

**Technology**

The integrated notebooks run on `Jupyter <https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

**Install additional kernels**

If you need kernels that are not pre-installed with your package of Verteego you can find more of them here:
