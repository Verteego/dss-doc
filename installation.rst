Installation
############

**Please note that in the following installation instructions we use 2 placeholders for local directories: VDS_ROOT and SSH_ROOT. Just replace them with the correct directories from your system.**

- VDS_ROOT: local directory where the installation package will be cloned to
- SSH_ROOT: local .ssh directory


1. Install Ansible
""""""""""""""""""
We'll use Ansible to deploy Verteego DS to your remote server or Virtualbox. If you don't have Ansible yet, please install it as we'll use Ansible to orchestrate the automatic installation process for you.

**Linux**

**Mac OS (Not tested)**

**Windows (Not tested)**

2. Clone installation package
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Clone the following repository to your local machine (NOT to the remote server on which you want run Verteego DS). We'll call this repository VDS_ROOT in the following.

::

    git clone git@github.com:Verteego/vds.git


3. Install Verteego DS
""""""""""""""""""""""

**INSTALLATION ON GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM**

**1. Install Google Cloud SDK**

Before you start you should make sure that you have a running Google Cloud platform account and the GCloud SDK installed (to install GCloud SDK: `https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs`_).

- Configure your account and project

::

    gcloud init



- Generate SSH key for GCloud

::

    gcloud compute config-ssh


**2. Set up the VDS environment on Google Cloud**

- Create a Google service account :
    - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts
    - Select the project into which you want to create the VDS instance
    - Create a service account with project editor role
    - Check the "Furnish a new private key" option
    - Chose JSON key type
    - When you click the "Create" button, a key file will be the downloaded. Copy the downloaded key file to VDS_ROOT/deployment/ansible/files and rename it to ansible.json

    :scale: 50%


::

     cp Downloads/ORIGINAL_KEYFILE.json VDS_ROOT/deployment/ansible/files/ansible.json


**3. Install libcloud**

::

    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    sudo pip install -U apache-libcloud


**4. Launch installation**

This will launch the default installation of Verteego Data Suite. For custom settings such as instance calibration, read `this <#custom-settings>`_.

::

    ansible-playbook -i VDS_ROOT/deployment/ansible/hosts --private-key=SSH_ROOT/google_compute_engine VDS_ROOT/deployment/ansible/setup_gc_instance.yml


- Be patient, the deployment of all files can take a while depending on the capacity of the instance you've chosen.


**5. Start playing**

- When the installation is terminated, navigate to the newly created instance IP (port 33330). You can find it on on your Google Cloud Compute Engine console: http://GC_INSTANCE_IP:33330


**INSTALLATION ON A LOCAL VIRTUAL SERVER (VIRTUALBOX)**


**1. Install Virtualbox and Vagrant**

- Install Virtualbox: `https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads`_.
NB: It is recommended to use the Debian 8 ("Jessie") distribution to optimize compatibility with Vagrant.

To install the right distribution of Virtualbox you can use this one-liner (for Linux):

::

    echo "deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian jessie contrib" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list && wget -q http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/oracle_vbox.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add - && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install virtualbox-5.1 && sudo usermod -G vboxusers -a $USER


- Install Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/


**2. Launch Vagrant**

- Go to the Vagrant directory (VDS_ROOT/vagrant) and launch Vagrant (this may take a while as it will download a full Debian image to be installed on Virtualbox):

::

    cd VDS_ROOT/vagrant
    vagrant up

**3. Installation**

- Launch installation

::

    ansible-playbook -i VDS_ROOT/deployment/ansible/hosts --private-key=VDS_ROOT/vagrant/.vagrant/machines/dss/virtualbox/private_key VDS_ROOT/setup_cluster.yml

**4. Start playing**

- Navigate to http://VIRTUALBOX_INSTANCE_IP:33330


3. Sign in
""""""""""

For your first sign in you can use the following credentials. For security reasons, remember to change them or delete the default user after your first login.

- Username: vds-user

- Password: verteego


4. Custom settings
""""""""""""""""""

**Customize infrastructure**

Your installation can be easily customised using the different .YML files in the VDS_ROOT/deployment/ansible directory.

Example: Use a high-memory instance on Google Cloud

- Open VDS_ROOT/deployment/ansible/setup_gc_instance.yml
- In the vars:machine_type variable replace n1-standard-1 with n1-highmem-16.

**Customize applications**

Open VDS_ROOT/deployment/ansible/group_vars/all/vars_file.yml to change the default settings for the different applications composing Verteego Data Suite.
