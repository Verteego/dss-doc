Installation
############

**Please note that in the following installation instructions we use 2 placeholders for local directories: VDS_ROOT and SSH_ROOT. Just replace them with the correct directories from your system.**

- VDS_ROOT: directory where Verteego Data Suite will be cloned
- SSH_ROOT: current user's .ssh directory path


1. Install Ansible
""""""""""""""""""
You need to have Ansible installed on your local machine to manage the automatic installation process for you. If you don't have it yet, please install Ansible as we'll use it to deploy Verteego DS to your remote server.

**INSTALLATION ON A LOCAL VIRTUAL SERVER (VIRTUALBOX)**

- Install Virtualbox : https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
- Install Vagrant    : https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/
- Go to the Vagrant directory (VDS_ROOT/vagrant) and launch Vagrant (this may take sometime as it will download a full debian image to install on Virtualbox):

::

    cd VDS_ROOT/vagrant
    vagrant up

- Run the Ansible playbook:

::

    ansible-playbook -i $VDS_ROOT/deployment/ansible/hosts --private-key=VDS_ROOT/vagrant/.vagrant/machines/dss/virtualbox/private_key $VDS_ROOT/setup_cluster.yml


- Navigate to http://VIRTUALBOX_INSTANCE_IP:33330



**INSTALLATION ON GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM**

**1. Install Google Cloud SDK**

You should have a running Google Cloud platform account and the SDK installed. It this is already the case you can directly proceed to step 2.

- Install GCloud SDK : https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/
- Configure your account and project

::

    gcloud init



- Generate SSH key for GCloud

::

    gcloud compute config-ssh


**2. Set up the VDS environment on Google Cloud**
- Create a Google service account :
    - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts
    - Select the project into which you want to create the VDS instance
    - Create a service account with project editor role:
    - Check the "Furnish a new private key" option
    - Chose JSON key type

    sudo pip install -U apache-libcloud


- Launch playbook:

::

    ansible-playbook -i VDS_ROOT/deployment/ansible/hosts --private-key=SSH_ROOT/google_compute_engine VDS_ROOT/deployment/ansible/setup_gc_instance.yml


- Be patient, the deployment of all files can take a while depending on the capacity of the server you've chosen.
- Navigate to the newly created instance IP (port 33330). You can find it on on your Google Cloud Compute Engine console: http://GC_INSTANCE_IP:33330
