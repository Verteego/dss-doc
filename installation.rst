Installation
############

You'll need to have Ansible running on your local machine to manage the automatic installation process for you.

**Please note that in the following installation instructions we use 2 placeholders for local directories: VDS_ROOT and SSH_ROOT. Just replace them with the correct directories from your system.**

- VDS_ROOT : directory where Verteego Data Suite will be cloned
- SSH_ROOT : current user's .ssh directory path

1. Clone Verteego Data Suite
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Clone the following repository to your local machine (NOT the remote server where you want to install Verteego DS, we'll precise this later).

- git clone git@bitbucket.org:verteegois/dss.git

2. Install Ansible
""""""""""""""""""
We'll use Ansible to deploy Verteego DS. If you don't have it yet, please install Ansible on your local machine.

.. code-block:: bash
     gcloud compute config-ssh

**2. Set up the VDS environment on Google Cloud**
- Create a Google service account :
    - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts
    - Select the project into which you want to create the VDS instance
    - Create a service account with project editor role:
    - Check the "Furnish a new private key" option
    - Chose JSON key type
    - Copy the downloaded key file to VDS_ROOT/deployment/ansible/files and rename it to ansible.json
