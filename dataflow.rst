The dataflow is the backbone of your data science project. It describes the different steps your data will run through from its origin to prediction or visualization.

The dataflow module is based on `Apache Nifi <https://nifi.apache.org/>`_, one of the most powerful data routing and transformation tools currently available. It offers a production-ready and highly configurable platform that can be connected to a large variety of data sources and formatting standards.
