The dataflow represents the backbone of your data science projects. It describes the different steps your data will run through from its source to prediction and visualization.

The dataflow module is based on the `Apache Nifi technology <https://nifi.apache.or>`_
, one of the most powerful data routing and transformation tools currently available. It offers a production-ready and highly configurable platform that can be run with a broad panel of data sources, formatting standards (XML, JSON, Avro, CSV, ...) and big data technologies (Hadoop, Kafka, HDFS, Flume, Elasticsearch, HBase, Couchbase, Mongo DB, Solr, Splunk, Lumberjack, Cassandra, Hive, ...) .
