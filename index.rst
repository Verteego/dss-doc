Docs
========================

`Read the Docs`_ hosts documentation for the open source community.
We support Sphinx_ docs written with reStructuredText_ and `CommonMark`_.
We pull your code from your Subversion_, Bazaar_, Git_, and Mercurial_ repositories.

The main documentation for the site is organized into a couple sections:
